## âœ… Executive Summary

### ðŸ“Œ Overview and Findings
-	At the beginning of 2021, sales continued to decline throughout the year, with a slight increase in August and a peak in November, reaching $79K in total sales. This was 3.4% lower compared to November sales from the previous year.
-	The year 2022 began with an increase in sales, showing a 29.5% growth in total sales compared to the previous year. This aligns with a surge in economy-wide spending driven by post-pandemic shifts in consumer behavior.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Insights Delivered
Based on the insights uncovered, the following recommendations are provided:

-	November consistently drives peak sales, with $118K in Nov 2023â€”up nearly 100% YoY from Nov 2022. Launch early-access VIP programs or bundles. With Nov contributing ~20% of annual revenue and 30% YoY growth, targeted marketing could drive $25Kâ€“$35K additional revenue annually.
-	Technology, Office Supplies, and Furniture account for 75%+ of sales. Bundle top-performing items with slow movers to manage inventory. Shift 15% more budget to tech/furniture adsâ€”expected 5â€“8% revenue boost (~$50K/year) if ROI holds.
-	Bookcases, Machines, Art, and Paper have <2 orders or consistent losses. Phase out SKUs selling <5/year unless strategic. Replace or bundle them in clearance to save ~$15K/year in warehousing/logistics.
-	California leads with 2,040 orders; NYC is the top city. Wyoming had just 1 order in 3 years. Invest in CA/NYC with local ads, email campaigns, and faster shipping. Run geo-targeted campaigns in underperforming states. 5% growth in CA = $12K, and 10% unlocked in the South = ~$20K.
-	2022 sales rose 29.5% post-pandemic, but 2023 growth slowed. Segment customers to identify high-LTV users. Retarget dormant 2022 buyers with loyalty programs or exclusive offers. Reactivating just 10% could recover ~$18K in revenue.
